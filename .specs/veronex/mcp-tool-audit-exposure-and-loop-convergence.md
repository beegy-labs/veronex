## §1 Problem (verified 2026-04-30 on dev `develop-4a5a5a4`)

### §1.1 Tool result invisible in UI

User submitted MCP request "오늘 마이크론 주가 분석" via test panel (`conv_338X2CaGOnhev7hZdxL5Q`). Bridge ran 5 MCP rounds:

| round | tool | args |
|-------|------|------|
| 0 | web_search | "마이크론 주가 오늘 분석" |
| 1 | web_search | "마이크론 테크놀로지 주가 상승 이유 오늘" |
| 2 | web_search | "마이크론 주가 최근 흐름 HBM DDR5 수혜" |
| 3 | get_weather | "New York" |
| 4 | get_datetime | "America/New_York" |

Each round's MCP execution wrote to `mcp_loop_tool_calls` table (per `flows/mcp.md` line 63 `batch_insert_tool_calls`). **But `GET /v1/conversations/{id}/turns/{job_id}/internals` returns only**:

```json
{
  "job_id": "...",
  "compressed": null,
  "vision_analysis": null
}
```

Tool-call audit data (args, result_text, outcome, latency_ms) is **never exposed** to the UI. Frontend conversation page therefore shows "결과 없음" for tool-only turns even though the bridge successfully fetched search results from MCP servers.

### §1.2 MCP loop never produces final text

The 5 rounds above all emitted tool_calls — no text content — and the loop exhausted at `MAX_MCP_ROUNDS=5`. Final response delivered to client: a single tool_call (`get_datetime`) wrapped in SSE chunks. `result_text` in `TurnRecord` is `null`. The model never converted the accumulated tool results into a final answer.

Per CDD `inference/mcp.md` line 234 references `mcp-schema.md` for the audit table. Per `flows/mcp.md`, the loop runs `for round in 0..max_rounds` — no boundary instruction is injected to force termination.

`LOOP_DETECT_THRESHOLD=3` only fires on **same `(name, args_hash)` triple-call**. Distinct args (different search queries) are not detected as a loop, so the model can use up the entire round budget on tool calls without ever producing text.

---

## §2 Root cause

### §2.1 §1.1 — `get_turn_internals` is incomplete

`conversation_handlers.rs::get_turn_internals` (line 275–356) loads the S3 `ConversationRecord`, finds the matching `TurnRecord`, and returns only `compressed` + `vision_analysis`. The handler intentionally surfaces what `TurnRecord` carries directly (`turn.compressed`, `turn.vision_analysis`) but **does not consult `mcp_loop_tool_calls`** — the very table CDD `mcp-schema.md` defines specifically as the per-tool audit log:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mcp_loop_tool_calls (
    id, mcp_loop_id, job_id, loop_round,
    server_id, tool_name, namespaced_name,
    args_json,                     -- input
    result_text,                   -- output (the data the user wants to see)
    outcome,                       -- success|error|timeout|cache_hit|circuit_open
    cache_hit, latency_ms, result_bytes,
    created_at
);
```

`bridge::batch_insert_tool_calls` writes every row. UI just doesn't have an API to read them back per-turn. Pure exposure gap.

### §2.2 §1.2 — no convergence forcing in `run_loop`

`bridge::run_loop` runs `for round in 0..max_rounds` and breaks only when:
1. `mcp_calls.is_empty()` (filter for MCP-prefixed names emptied)
2. `loop_detected` (per (name, args_hash) hits `LOOP_DETECT_THRESHOLD=3`)
3. `round_result.passthrough_streamed` (S20 mixed-delta safety)
4. `provider.submit` fails

When the model emits a different MCP tool each round (different query, different tool, different args), conditions 1, 2, 3 never trigger and the loop runs all `max_rounds` iterations. The final round result is whatever the last round emitted (more often than not, another tool_call) — never a forced final text.

Industry pattern (LangGraph `recursion_limit` + boundary prompt; OpenAI Agents SDK `tool_choice` escalation): at the last round, the agent injects a **system message constraining tool_choice to "none"** so the model has no option but to produce text using the accumulated tool results.

veronex bridge does not have this. Fix this.

## §3 Solution

### §3.1 Tier A — extend `TurnInternalsResponse` with `tool_calls` field

Schema (CDD `mcp-schema.md` already defines `mcp_loop_tool_calls`; this is read-side projection):

```rust
// crates/veronex/src/infrastructure/inbound/http/conversation_handlers.rs

#[derive(Debug, Serialize)]
pub struct ToolCallDetail {
    pub round: i16,
    pub server_slug: String,
    pub tool_name: String,
    pub namespaced_name: String,
    pub args: serde_json::Value,
    pub result_text: Option<String>,
    pub outcome: String,
    pub cache_hit: bool,
    pub latency_ms: Option<i32>,
    pub result_bytes: Option<i32>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize)]
pub struct TurnInternalsResponse {
    pub job_id: String,
    pub compressed: Option<CompressedTurnDetail>,
    pub vision_analysis: Option<VisionAnalysisDetail>,
    /// MCP per-tool audit for this turn — joined from `mcp_loop_tool_calls`.
    /// Empty Vec when no MCP tools were invoked. Ordered by `loop_round ASC, created_at ASC`.
    pub tool_calls: Vec<ToolCallDetail>,
}
```

Handler change: add a SQL fetch in `get_turn_internals`:

```rust
let tool_calls: Vec<ToolCallDetail> = sqlx::query_as!(...)
    .bind(job_uuid)
    .fetch_all(&state.pg_pool)
    .await
    .unwrap_or_default();
```

JOIN against `mcp_servers` for `server_slug` (or use `namespaced_name` parser). Order by `loop_round, created_at`.

### §3.2 Tier B — UI surface

`web/app/jobs/components/api-test-conversation.tsx` already takes `messages: ConversationMessage[]`. Extend the message component to optionally render a tool_call panel for each round:

- For `assistant` message with `tool_calls`: above the (empty) content, render an expandable `<ToolCallTimeline>` block listing each call:
  - tool name (slug-stripped)
  - input args (collapsed JSON)
  - result preview (first 500 chars; expand to full)
  - outcome badge (success/error/cache_hit/circuit_open)
  - latency_ms

Data source: when the conversation page renders a turn, fetch `/v1/conversations/{conv_id}/turns/{job_id}/internals` (already exists) and use the new `tool_calls` array.

### §3.3 Tier C — convergence forcing

Modification to `bridge::run_loop`:

```rust
for round in 0..max_rounds {
    // ── New §3.3 — convergence boundary on the final round ────────────────
    // If we are about to dispatch the LAST allowed round and the loop has
    // produced no text yet, inject a system message that constrains the
    // model to text-only output using the tool results already accumulated.
    // Pattern: LangGraph recursion_limit + boundary prompt; OpenAI Agents
    // SDK tool_choice="none" escalation.
    if round == max_rounds - 1 && content.is_empty() && rounds > 0 {
        messages.push(serde_json::json!({
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You have reached the final response step. \
                Do NOT call any more tools. Using the tool results above, \
                produce the user's final answer in natural language now."
        }));
        info!(round, "MCP convergence: final-round system message injected");
    }
    // ── /Tier C ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    let job_id = match state.use_case.submit(SubmitJobRequest { ... }).await { ... };
    // ... rest unchanged
}
```

Effect:
- After the boundary system message, the next (last) round is the model's final chance. Most instruction-tuned models honor "no more tools" + "produce answer now".
- If the model still emits tool_calls (degenerate case), the loop ends at `max_rounds` with whatever the last round produced; the bridge's `streamed_via_tap` (S20) plus the new `tool_calls` audit (Tier A) means the UI still shows the full chain — the user is informed of the failure mode rather than seeing a silent "결과 없음".

### §3.4 Why this is "complete" (no compromise)

| Concern | How addressed |
|---------|---------------|
| User can't see tool results | Tier A — JOIN audit table, expose via existing internals endpoint |
| Model never converges to text | Tier C — boundary system message at last round (industry pattern) |
| If model still doesn't converge after Tier C | Tier A still shows full audit chain; user understands the failure mode; future improvement = lower `max_rounds` or stronger prompt — separate tuning |
| Schema migration | None — `mcp_loop_tool_calls` already exists per `mcp-schema.md` |
| Backward compat | `tool_calls: Vec<ToolCallDetail>` defaults to empty — old clients ignore extra field |

## §5 Tests

| # | Test | Module |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `get_turn_internals` returns `tool_calls=[]` when no MCP calls were made | conversation_handlers integration |
| 2 | `get_turn_internals` returns N entries when N tool calls were inserted; entries ordered by `loop_round` ASC | conversation_handlers integration |
| 3 | `ToolCallDetail` correctly carries `result_text`, `outcome="success"`, `latency_ms` | conversation_handlers unit |
| 4 | Bridge `run_loop` injects boundary system message exactly when `round == max_rounds-1 && rounds > 0 && content.is_empty()` | bridge unit |
| 5 | Convergence sentinel: loop where all rounds emit tool_calls + boundary message injected → assertion that the final round's input messages contain the boundary system message | bridge integration with mock model |
| 6 | (regression) all existing 34 bridge tests pass unchanged | bridge unit |

### §6.1 Setup
- Image rolled out to `develop-<this PR sha>`
- `qwen3-coder-next-200k:latest` warm

### §6.2 PASS conditions

| # | Check |
|---|---|
| L1 | Submit "오늘 마이크론 주가 분석" with `use_mcp:true` |

## §8 Out of Scope

- Lowering `MAX_MCP_ROUNDS` (currently 5) — separate tuning task.
- Stricter `LOOP_DETECT_THRESHOLD` reduction — current 3 is conservative; revisit only if production sees more degenerate cases.
- Per-server MCP tool result truncation policy in audit response — current full `result_text` exposure (TEXT column) is fine for dashboard view.
- Streaming `tool_calls` field in real-time during the bridge loop (server-push to UI mid-stream) — current model: UI fetches internals after turn completes. Real-time streaming is a separate UX SDD.
- Dedicated UI to inspect `mcp_loop_tool_calls` rows globally (cross-conversation analytics) — separate dashboard SDD.
